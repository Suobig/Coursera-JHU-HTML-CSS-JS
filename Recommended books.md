## Web Design with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery Set *by Jon Duckett*

MY ABSOLUTE TOP PICK. This is a set that combines 2 books for a cheaper price. Both books are excellent: very visual, easy to look up things in, and get straight to the point without a lot of blah blah.

## JavaScript and JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development *by Jon Duckett*

MY TOP PICK FOR JAVASCRIPT. Just like his HTML/CSS book, this one is very visual and gets to the point quickly.

## Pragmatic Guide to Git *by Travis Swicegood*

MY TOP PICK FOR GIT. I am a BIG fan of pretty much any Pragmatic programming series book. This one is great as well! Explains the concepts well, so you are not just memorizing commands.

## HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites *by Jon Duckett*

MY TOP PICK FOR HTML/CSS. Great book that is very visually oriented. It’s very easy to look through, especially if you are in a hurry. It’s also very concise and to the point.

## Learning Web App Development *by Semmy Purewal*

A student found this book and states that “its close to what is taught in this course”. Looks like a great book from first glance and does sound close to what we cover in the course.
